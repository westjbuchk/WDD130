<p> Hello! My name is Weston! I'm from New York, I have been a member of the church my whole life, and this is my second semester at BYUI </p>
<p> I am currently majoring in psychology with the hopes of going to med school and then getting a residency in psychiatry </p>
<p> I love doing anything, but I mostly love going on hikes, playing volleyball, and playing pickleball.</p>
